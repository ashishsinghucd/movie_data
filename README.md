This repo is used to process images of hollywood
movie.

The main aim is used to classify the images into
genres, ratings etc. based on the content in the 
images. 

The final aim is to use deep learning techniques 
on these images.

Thanks to OMDB for providing the free api to access
the images of the movies. I am using the IMDB 
movie id to download the images. These id's are
obtained from the movielens dataset. Please visit
